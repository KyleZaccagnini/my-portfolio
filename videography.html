I wanted to encapsulate his vibe as an artist along with how the music makes me feel and think. I used Adobe After Effects to create all of this. The song Feels Like We Only Go Backwards by Tame Impala is used for only Portfolio Use.</h3>

I decided to use a song from Tyler the Creator and made a story about a man who is deciding between dating someone or remaining as someone who isn't locked down to anyone. I acted in the video, as well as edited the entire video. The use of the song Darling I, by Tyler the Creator is for Portfolio use only.</h3>

Using Adobe After Effects was very new for me at the time and I was very experimental with things as I wanted to learn more about it and grow!</h3>
