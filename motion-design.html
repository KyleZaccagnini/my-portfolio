I used the song greenlight by Tate McRae and note that the use of this image is just for portfolio use. I used adobe illustrator and after effects to create my own shapes and assets and to animate their movements.</h3>

The use of the music by Tate McRae is for portfolio use only.</h3>

I created everything you see in Adobe Illustrator and then took those files into Adobe After Effects and animated them using keyframing.
